Join me, Rachel Goth, Mind Management Coach, for an introduction to Emotional Freedom Technique, also known as EFT or Tapping. Learn how to use this simple, easy, life changing method to help manage your own stress, anxiety, over thinking, worry or even food cravings! Once learned this is a tool you’ll find yourself coming back to again and again.

* In the very first session you’ll learn the EFT points themselves and we’ll practice using them together. (They are all upper body, mostly the face and all tapped over the clothes.)
* You’ll learn how to use tapping to reduce stress, anxiety and over thinking as well as to improve your performance in any arena.
* Then we’ll move on to using EFT for other issues and learning some alternative tapping patterns which can be helpful.
* As we go along there’ll be time to give feedback on your experiences of using EFT on your own and to ask any questions which cropped up for you in your practice.
* There’ll be time for everyone to tap together on specific issues and we’ll finish each session with a Q&A to cement all your learnings.

The course takes place on Zoom and you have the choice of taking it over either 2 sessions or 3 shorter sessions.
