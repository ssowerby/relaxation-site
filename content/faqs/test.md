title: What do I need in order to have an online session with you?
---
All you need is your laptop or Ipad, a decent internet connection and some privacy in a place where you can safely relax undisturbed for the duration of the session. You will need to download a free application called Zoom if you don't already have it. I will send you a link to it.\

If you're worried about it working we can have a test run before the appointment to make sure we can see and hear eachother.
