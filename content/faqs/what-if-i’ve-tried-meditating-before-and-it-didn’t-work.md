title: What if I’ve tried meditating before and it didn’t work?

Don’t worry, you won’t be sitting meditating for an hour. I'm a trained hypnotherapist so I have a number of techniques to help your mind and body to relax. The more feedback you give me the more I can tailor our sessions to what works for you.
