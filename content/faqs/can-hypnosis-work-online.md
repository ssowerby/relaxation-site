title: Can hypnosis work online?
---
At the end of the day all hypnosis is self hypnosis. It involves you following along with the hypnotherapist's suggestions and choosing which to take onboard. It works the same way whether  in person or online. The benefit of having sessions online, apart from the convenience, is that you can be in your own familiar environment rather than travelling to a strange office. This can help you to relax even deeper.
