title: How do I book?
---
Send me an email/text or give me a call to let me know you'd like to book. I like to have a chat with people first to make sure we are a good fit to work together.  I will then book you in and send you payment details. The booking is not confirmed until payment is made. Payment is required at least 48 hours before an appointment.
