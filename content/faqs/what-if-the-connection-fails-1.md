title: What if I fall a sleep?
---
It can happen if you haven’t relaxed in a while or you’re not getting enough sleep but it's not very common. I can either gently wake you or some clients like to be left to sleep if it’s an evening appointment. For reassurance you could also set an alarm to wake you at a certain time.
