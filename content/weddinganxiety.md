Weddings should be a special time of celebration for families and friends but all too often they can be stressful affairs which rush by in an anxious blur. 

* Managing who sits next to who so there are no arguments.
* Contemplating standing up to give your speech and sweating just at the thought of it.
* Feeling a rising sense of panic as you get closer to the day when you’ll stand up in front of friends and family.

Let’s get rid of that anxiety together so you can get back to enjoying this happy occasion and 

* Be relaxed in the run up to your special day so you canenjoy the preparations
* Feel present on the day itself so you can savour every precious moment
* Be confident giving that speech or saying your vows so you can relax on your special day
