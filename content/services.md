## Hypnotherapy Sessions for Stress, Anxiety and Fear

Sometimes a nagging fear or anxiety motivates us to deal with a problem and then it switches off. Like getting you to prepare for a client meeting or arrange for someone to look at the funny noise the boiler is making. Sometimes however you can feel a knot in your stomach or be consumed by worry but there either isn’t a problem to solve or it isn’t something you can fix. In that kind of situation hypnotherapy can help.

**When you have a fear or anxiety which you can’t argue yourself out of hypnosis is a very useful tool**. It’s the ideal therapy for automatic reactions which are driven by the subconscious part of your mind because it’s aimed directly at your subconscious.

### What is hypnosis?

Hypnosis is a state of mind, a kind of trance which you’ll find you’re familiar with. It’s akin to the trance of day dreaming, how you feel when you’re close to drifting off to sleep or how you feel when you’re absorbed in a book or a hobby. It’s a kind of internal focus in which you become absorbed in what you’re doing or imagining rather than what’s happening around you. 

You know those times when you’re in the flow and when you look up more time has passed than you thought? It’s that kind of experience. We use it because it’s similar to the state of mind when we process memories from the learnings of the day during sleep.

### How does hypnotherapy work?

Hypnotherapy helps you to make changes on a subconscious level. We all have a part of our brain which runs below the level of conscious thought. It keeps your blood pumping, regulates your breathing, moves the muscles in your legs when you walk.

Once you’ve learned something well enough this part takes over responsibility for it. So you can automatically tie your shoe laces, driving a car or ride a bike. The subconscious part of your mind creates an automatic programme for the behaviour and runs it so you don’t have to waste brain power thinking about it. Imagine if you had to think about everything you did every day like getting up, cleaning your teeth, getting dressed, making breakfast? It would be exhausting, not to mention boring. When it works well our subconscious saves us a lot of conscious effort.

The problem is sometimes the subconscious can make less helpful processes automatic like panicking every time you have to speak in public or interpreting anything that doesn’t work out as meaning you’re stupid or feeling fear when there’s no danger. It can be difficult to talk yourself out of these feelings because they happen automatically. With hypnotherapy we can reach the subconscious part of the mind which is running the automatic programme and correct it.

### What happens in a hypnotherapy session?

In the first session we’ll discuss what it is you’d like to change and define the goal for our sessions together. From here we will move into the trance part of the session. It’s not the dramatic stage or watch swinging experience you might expect. 

I use an indirect form of hypnosis which is more like a relaxing conversation in which I offer you helpful suggestions and imaginative exercises. You will be aware and in control. You may feel a bit like you’re day dreaming. You might remember everything I say or not much, it doesn’t really matter. 

Most people find it relaxing and some say it feels like the few moments before you drift off into sleep. The point is we’re accessing the subconscious part of your mind where we can make changes relatively quickly.

In the following sessions we check on your progress and tailor the session to move you a step further towards your goal.

### How many sessions will I need?

In most cases we can deal with the issue sufficiently within four sessions but of course there’s no guarantee as each person is unique.

### Where do sessions take place?

All sessions take place online which means no commuting time and you can take that relaxed feeling straight into your business meeting, evening wind down or whatever you’re doing next.
