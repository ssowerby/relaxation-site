“Just relax”, “don’t worry about it”, “love yourself”. 

Whether those statements from well meaning friends and family make you want to barf or punch a wall, you’re in the right place. What I offer are highly practical sessions in which I’ll guide you through what to do. One method may not work for you but I have plenty more so don’t worry. Together we will find what works for you and you’ll experience relaxation more deeply than you might ever have before. It can take a little practice but once you master it it’s something you can incorporate into your day that won’t take up a lot of time and you’ll actually enjoy doing.

Cantankerous boss, over bearing clients, trains always late, over running projects, family friction, potential sources of stress are a constant. But you can get off the merry-go-round. Which doesn’t mean it will stop spinning but does mean you won’t be in a spin with it. When you relax it’s like putting petrol in the tank. You have the fuel to deal with whatever comes your way without it depleting you. When you relax little and often you’re keeping your tank topped up, ready for when you need it. You know what I mean. Dealing with that awkward customer when you’re already feeling stressed and anxious makes it so much worse. It’s like all of your buttons have risen to the surface and they know just how to play you like a piano to make you jump to their tune. Imagine how much smoother life can go when you’re well rested, calm and those buttons are harder to press.

Together we’ll find you your unique tool kit of methods you can use everyday to keep that relaxation tank topped up.
