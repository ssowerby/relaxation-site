I felt that I had zero creativity at all. I felt blocked to move forward with all the ideas I had.

I had quite a few lightbulb moments and feel that my creativity has been unlocked. The lightbulb moments were really easy things to implement. Just talking through the issues I was having with someone who knew nothing about me or my business was refreshing. I find I am always so immersed in my work that I just can't think straight or have the headspace to come up with a plan. Our sessions really helped me think through and being able to easily add in the things you suggested mean that I now have a strategy in place for every idea.

I loved that you had ideas as well as giving me space to come up with ideas. It felt like you gave me ownership to come up with the ideas but you just asked the right questions to help me get to that place. (If that makes sense!)

In a very short space of time Rachel helped me go from overwhelm to organised. I feel a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders and feel that I can really achieve all of my goals. Before I felt like I was floundering from the overwhelm and achieving nothing, but with a few simple easy to implement strategies I've already started achieving more than I have in the last few months. Thank you Rachel.
