Working with Rachel has been a revelation. After years of going through counselling and CBT for depression, there was a little part of me that was holding my self-confidence back, especially in work situations which was proving particularly stressful. Over the past few months I have developed a real sense of calm and a seen a deduction in me over thinking and ruminating on situations I have been in. I’m also seeing gradual improvements in being able to keep my emotions in check, especially when I’m put on the spot. I had my end of probation meeting with my manager the week before last and he finds it very easy to point out people’s faults without necessarily making the feedback constructive. At one point I did feel the emotion well up but I found it calmed down a lot quicker than it may have had previously and I was able to get back to making the point I needed to. During that same week I went for an interview and am very pleased to say I was offered the job! Despite slight initial nerves, and the feeling that I hadn’t been able to do enough prep, I was able to easily put those thoughts to one side, walked in there feeling confident and walked out feeling even more confident. Not only that I barely ruminated on the interview for the rest of day which I previously would have done. I don’t think I would have had the same experience without our sessions! Thank you.
