I had lost a lot of my creativity due to my mind being so full of thoughts, I was distracted a lot of the time and couldn't get in, or stay in the flow for my creative work. Working with you gave me a reset, to remind me to get back to my meditation practice, also deep breathing and a short meditation/mindfulness exercise before starting work. I am much more creative now thanks to working with you.
