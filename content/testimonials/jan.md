I believe that Rachel’s coaching would benefit anyone that feels that they overthink things, are disorganised or hates making plans - especially if they believe that they can’t stick to goals. Rachel helps to identify what the block is and comes up with a strategy to overcome it.

I would recommend Rachel because she made a real difference in my life. Beforehand I couldn’t see what was holding me back, and now I have a strategy that works and I can apply to future goals. And I know that when I need her in the future, Rachel will be there to back me up in her easy insightful manner without judgement or pressure.
