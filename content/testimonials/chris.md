Generally in life, I am a confident person. However in the classroom, when it came to putting my hand up to answer questions, I could not bring myself to do it. I would think of an answer and say nothing. The tutor would take answers from around the room until eventually, someone would say what I was thinking. Then I felt worse, what was the point in putting my hand up now. I began to dread this part of the class. During the session with Rachel, she gave me the confidence to open up about my fear. After just one session it was no longer an issue. In my very next class, the worry had gone and I found my hand going up without thinking. It made my course so much easier and more enjoyable.
