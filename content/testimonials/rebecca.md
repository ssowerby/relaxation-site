Working with Rachel has fundamentally shifted the way I see myself, and the world, for the better. She helped me understand the wider context to my specific thoughts and feelings, which ultimately relieved a heavy burden – I began to understand that I’m not flawed. Rather, I was caught in perfectly natural pattern, that I could absolutely escape. I also thoroughly enjoyed the hypnosis, which I found to be extremely relaxing.
