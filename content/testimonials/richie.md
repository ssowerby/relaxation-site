I would highly recommend Rachel as a practitioner for improving sports performance. I was always berating myself for poor play, ‘’ I should have done this or that’’ or distracted by ‘’peripheral noise.’’ The breakthrough for me was using the relaxation techniques and the positive thinking approach she taught me. This has helped me accept a bad shot, hole or outcome and focus on the next task at hand. Since our sessions together my golf mental state has improved immeasurably. I’m now enjoying playing golf and saving strokes as well. I look forward to learning more from Rachel in the future.
