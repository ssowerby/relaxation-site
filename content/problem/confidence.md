<h3>Lack of Confidence</h3>
</header>

<ul>
<li>Who am I to be doing this?
<li>I’ve been lucky so far but what if they realise I’m rubbish?
<li>There’s so much competition why would anyone choose my work?
<li>The thought of showing people what I do makes me feel sick.
<li>What if everyone hates it?
</ul>
