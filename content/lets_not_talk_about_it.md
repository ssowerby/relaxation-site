## About

Hi, I’m Rachel a coach and clinical hypnotherapist who is passionate about working with people who are stuck in stressed and anxious states to unwind and relax more. Working in the helping profession I’ve noticed there are some people who either don’t want to talk about their issues or can’t and it stops them from getting the help they need. With the Let’s Not Talk About It programme I want to work with those people to get them on the path to healthier mental well being. Because being too stressed or anxious for too long is detrimental to mental well-being and physical health.
