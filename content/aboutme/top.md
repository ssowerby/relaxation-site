  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="text">

Hi Iâ€™m **Rachel Goth, the voice coach**. I help motivated coaches, therapists and teachers learn to **love their voice** so they can share their message **without having to change the way they speak**.

I can help you **stop cringing when you hear your voice** and wishing you sounded like someone else. Using a combination of coaching, mindfulness, visualization and practical exercises I help you change the way you feel about your voice and become **confident in expressing yourself** on video and audio so you can **share your message**.
