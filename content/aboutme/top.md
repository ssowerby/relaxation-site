Hi I’m Rachel Goth, I help artists and makers turn their hobby into a business by supporting them to become confident in their work and able to take the actions to build their business. 

I can help you get out of the loop of procrastination and anxiety to start taking action towards your goals more consistently. Using a combination of coaching, mindfulness, visualisation and other mindset techniques I help you get over what’s holding you back and start implementing what you’ve learned on all those business courses rather than just learning more.

Ever since I can remember I was making things and writing stories. When I became a graphic designer in a web company I felt like I’d landed my dream job. I actually got paid to play around with colour and form, to bring my imaginings to life. I was buzzing to get going on every project. It was like something had clicked into place inside me and I was completely in my flow. 

But gradually over the years, working in different companies, that excitement of starting a new project, the satisfaction of bringing my creation into the world, it had ebbed away. I was frustrated with myself for not enjoying it anymore. I was fretting over whether my ideas were good enough rather than being excited by the challenge. I felt like an imposter waiting to be found out. I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning and the working day felt so long.  Eventually I convinced myself what I needed to get that passion back was to make real, tangible things I could touch with my hands. So I set my sights on working for myself as a jewellery designer.

And I was so excited, doodling designs on the train to work, researching materials in my lunch breaks, using every spare moment I had until I made it a reality. I felt alive again and in my flow. And it was great, my favourite shop bought my designs, I got to see my necklaces on the catwalk, even in a magazine. However soon enough that joy ebbed away again. I was back in that quagmire of self doubt. Feeling like I wasn’t good enough. Dreading every email or communication with a customer. Wanting to hide away. 

So I left design behind and spent the following years trying out different jobs, trying to find what was missing. But it never felt right. I could get into my flow but I couldn’t stay there for long without the self doubt, criticism and sense of dread taking over.

Eventually I felt so disheartened I started looking for something to fix that feeling inside and gravitated towards learning hypnotherapy and other healing techniques. These were a revelation for me. By practicing them I began to heal that hole inside. Not only did I get the benefit myself of feeling calmer and more relaxed, I was also using my creativity again, this time to help people relax with their imperfections and let go of their anxiety and stress to feel more joy in their lives. I felt alive with purpose again and in that sweet spot of my flow.

And slowly, as I worked with all these people, it dawned on me what I’d been missing back then when I was a designer. It wasn’t that I’d fallen out of love with being creative, it was all the other stuff around it which had sucked the joy out of it. Putting my work out into the world and worrying nobody would like it, fearing my luck would run out and people would discover I was rubbish at design, feeling every negative comment like a blow to the stomach, being frustrated with myself for procrastinating so much and not just getting on with it, avoiding actually selling my jewellery, never being sure if I was good enough to do this. All the stuff I never even thought about back when I was a child doodling in my bedroom dreaming of a creative career.

Because nobody prepares you for it. It probably wasn’t mentioned by your design teachers and only briefly referred to in those business courses you took. But it’s actually a huge part of having a business. And now I have the skills to share with other artists and makers too so they can overcome their worries, fear and anxieties to have the business they desire and feel that childhood joy in creating again.

So that’s what I do. I help artists and makers turn their dream into a business by supporting them to become confident in their work and how to take the action to build their business.
