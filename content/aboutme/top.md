  <h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="text">

Hi I’m Rachel Goth, I help artists and makers turn their hobby into a business by supporting them to become confident in their work and able to take the actions to build their business. 

I can help you get out of the loop of procrastination and anxiety to start taking action towards your goals more consistently. Using a combination of coaching, mindfulness, visualisation and other mindset techniques I help you get over what’s holding you back and start implementing what you’ve learned on all those business courses rather than just learning more.
