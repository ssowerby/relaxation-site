Ever since I can remember I was making things and writing stories. When I became a graphic designer in a web company I felt like Iâ€™d landed my dream job. I actually got paid to play around with colour and form, to bring my imaginings to life. I was buzzing to get going on every project. It was like something had clicked into place inside me and I was completely in my flow.
