From my very first client I was hooked. She came to me because she didn’t like the way her voice sounded and it was holding her back. She wanted to coach people and create her own courses so this was a real stumbling block for her. She believed that people wouldn’t listen to her because of her accent and was in a dilemma because it also didn’t feel natural talking any other way. It was holding her back from saying what she wanted to say both professionally and personally. 

In the past she had made some social media content before, for a bit, but then she’d retreat because it was just too painful putting herself out there when she felt there was something wrong with her voice. She was even holding herself back from commenting in groups where she was sure she could help people. 

Well after our very first session she started working on creating a course she’d been wanting to make for a long time because she was already starting to feel comfortable with being herself and realizing people would want to listen to her. Within 3 weeks she’d finished creating her first course, posted about it on social media and made some YouTube videos, all with a natural ease which really surprised her. And she made 3 sales from people who saw her content. By the end of week 3 she was already working on her second course. Two weeks after she’d finished working with me she’d made another 23 sales.
