Eventually I felt so disheartened I started looking for something to fix that feeling inside and gravitated towards learning hypnotherapy and other healing techniques. These were a revelation for me. By practicing them I began to heal that hole inside. Not only did I get the benefit myself of feeling calmer and more relaxed, I was also using my creativity again, this time to help people relax with their imperfections and let go of their anxiety and stress to feel more joy in their lives. I felt alive with purpose again and in that sweet spot of my flow.
