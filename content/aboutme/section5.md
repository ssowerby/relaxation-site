I’m a Scouser myself and as a child my mum wanted me to have elocution lessons. I refused but still it left me thinking there must be something wrong with my voice or why would she want me to change it. It took me a good few years to realise it was her own voice my mum didn’t like and **she was projecting her anxieties on to me**.
