## Variety is the spice of life 

**Your unique sound** is one of the things which will make you stand out and **attract people to you**. Because when you feel comfortable with yourself just as you are it shines through and people see it. 

You weren’t born disliking your voice. Things have happened in life which have created that belief for you. And that’s what it is, **a belief, not a fact**. And when we work together we can change that so you can learn to like your voice again and **feel confident speaking**.
