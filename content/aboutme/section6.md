And slowly, as I worked with all these people, it dawned on me what I’d been missing back then when I was a designer. It wasn’t that I’d fallen out of love with being creative, it was all the other stuff around it which had sucked the joy out of it. 

* Putting my work out into the world and **worrying nobody would like it**.
* **Fearing my luck would run out** and people would discover I was rubbish at design.
* **Feeling every negative comment** like a blow to the stomach. 
* Being frustrated with myself for **procrastinating** so much and not just getting on with it. 
* **Avoiding actually selling** my jewellery, never being sure if I was good enough to do this.  

All the stuff I never even thought about back when I was a child doodling in my bedroom dreaming of a creative.
