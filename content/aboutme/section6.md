And slowly, as I worked with all these people, it dawned on me what I’d been missing back then when I was a designer. It wasn’t that I’d fallen out of love with being creative, it was all the other stuff around it which had sucked the joy out of it. Putting my work out into the world and worrying nobody would like it, fearing my luck would run out and people would discover I was rubbish at design, feeling every negative comment like a blow to the stomach, being frustrated with myself for procrastinating so much and not just getting on with it, avoiding actually selling my jewellery, never being sure if I was good enough to do this. All the stuff I never even thought about back when I was a child doodling in my bedroom dreaming of a creative career.
