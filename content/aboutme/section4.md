And I was so excited, doodling designs on the train to work, researching materials in my lunch breaks, using every spare moment I had until I made it a reality. I felt alive again and in my flow. And it was great, my favourite shop bought my designs, I got to see my necklaces on the catwalk, even in a magazine. However soon enough that joy ebbed away again. I was back in that quagmire of self doubt. Feeling like I wasn’t good enough. Dreading every email or communication with a customer. Wanting to hide away. 

So I left design behind and spent the following years trying out different jobs, trying to find what was missing. But it never felt right. I could get into my flow but I couldn’t stay there for long without the self doubt, criticism and sense of dread taking over.
