Being able to speak freely opens up so many opportunities professionally and personally. My clients are 

* **Recording courses** they’ve been wanting to make for a long time
* **Creating meditation audios**
* **Starting new businesses**
* **Having deeper conversations**. 

They’re not procrastinating any more or holding themselves back or avoiding opportunities because they generally **feel more confident speaking up and sharing**. 

And it always surprises them how much has changed for them in the short amount of time we worked together. How much more confident, at ease and relaxed they are. It blows their mind and it’s hugely rewarding to be a part of.
