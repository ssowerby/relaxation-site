I **trained as a hypnotherapist and coach** which has sparked off a lifelong interest in learning about mindset. I’ve helped people with many different anxieties and fears over the years. And now I bring all my training and experience to helping people like you learn to like your voice and feel comfortable being yourself. 

Because I believe it’s important we all shine as ourselves and encourage each other to be who we are. The world doesn’t need a load of clones, it needs all the unique, quirky, funny and delightful things that make you you. And it’s my pleasure to be a part of your journey.
