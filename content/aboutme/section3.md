But gradually over the years, working in different companies, that excitement of starting a new project, the satisfaction of bringing my creation into the world, it had ebbed away. I was frustrated with myself for not enjoying it anymore. I was fretting over whether my ideas were good enough rather than being excited by the challenge. I felt like an imposter waiting to be found out. I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning and the working day felt so long.  Eventually I convinced myself what I needed to get that passion back was to make real, tangible things I could touch with my hands. So I set my sights on working for myself as a jewellery designer.
