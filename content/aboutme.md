Hi I'm Rachel, the creative person's fire lighter. 

### The reason I do my work today is because too many creative professionals and entrepreneurs are struggling with creative burn out sucking the joy out of their work. So I help them rekindle their passion so they enjoy being creative again.

Ever since I can remember I was making things and writing stories. When I became a graphic designer in a web company I felt like I’d landed my dream job. I actually got paid to play around with colour and form, to bring my imaginings to life.  

But gradually over the years, working in different companies, that excitement of starting a new project, the satisfaction of seeing my finished creation, it had ebbed away. And I convinced myself what I needed to get that passion back was to make real, tangible things I could touch with my hands. So I set might sights on becoming a jewellery designer. 

And I was so excited, doodling designs on the train to work and in my lunch breaks, every spare moment I had until I made it a reality. And it was great, my favourite shop bought my designs, I got to see my necklaces on the catwalk, even in a magazine. However soon enough that joy ebbed away again and I spent the following years trying out different jobs, chasing that missing feeling.\

Eventually I felt so disheartened I started looking for something to fix that feeling inside and I gravitated towards learning hypnotherapy and other healing techniques which was awesome. And not only did I get the benefit myself of feeling calmer and more relaxed, I was also using my creativity again, this time to help people relax with their imperfections and let go of their anxiety and stress to feel more joy in their lives. 

And slowly, as I was working with all these people, it dawned on me what I’d been missing back then when I was a designer. It wasn’t that I’d fallen out of love with being creative, it was all the other stuff around it which had sucked the joy out of it. The worry over tight deadlines, clients changing their mind at the last minute, the fear of not knowing where my next design would come from or whether it would be good enough. 

All the stuff I never even thought about back when when I was a child doodling in my bedroom. The stuff that wasn't even mentioned by my design teachers. And now I had the skills to share with other creatives so they could overcome their worries, fear and anxieties too and find that childhood joy of creating again. 

So that’s what I do. I help creatives reignite their creative spark so they can get back to loving what they do right now without struggling for years to find the answers.
