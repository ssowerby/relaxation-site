## How are we going to do it?

We’re going to do this through a combination of mindset coaching and practical exercises. In our sessions together we’ll remove any blocks which have been holding you back and boost your confidence in your voice. And between sessions there will be practical exercises to get you into taking regular action towards your goals. You will also get extra support via Messenger 5 days a week. 

And it will only take you up to 20 minutes a day between sessions to get you into momentum. Less time than you’ve been wasting feeling anxious and procrastinating.

### The Cringe to Confidence Programme in a nutshell:

* 4 x 1:1 coaching calls on Zoom, bespoke to you and your voice goals.
* Mini exercises of less than 20 minutes a day to get you moving forward.
* Extra support via Messenger 5 days a week 10-6pm.

Interested? I only work with people after speaking with them first, to make sure we're a good fit.
