How awesome would that be?

You might wonder if that’s even possible, after all you’ve already learned all the business stuff but it still doesn’t work. Well unless you’re taking regular action using all that knowledge it’s not going to work. 

You’ve done the learning around the business part. What I’m going to help you with is creating the mindset you need to make those business tools you already have work for you. Mindset is the piece of the puzzle which is often missing. When it comes together with your art skills and business knowledge it can help you get moving towards your goals.
