## But could it really work for you?  

You weren’t born having a problem with the way you sound. It’s something you’ve acquired along the way. And you can learn to get past this too. Because on the other side is your future, sharing and connecting, spreading your message.

My clients have usually wrestled with their feelings about their voice for a long time before they come to see me. Some have tried themselves to speak differently and change their voice but it felt fake, unnatural and a huge effort to keep up. Others have been on courses to change their voice but it hasn’t worked for them.



What’s different about my programme is we’re not going to change your voice, we’re going to change how you feel about it and that’s the key. You will flow more naturally, the words will come with ease and you’ll sound more relaxed because you’re confident with how you sound. And it won’t be an effort to keep up because you’re just being you.
