# Work With Me

## Is this you?

* You don’t like your voice
* You’ve tried to change your voice with courses or by yourself and it doesn’t work
* It feels so uncomfortable to talk on video or audio that it all comes out wrong
* You don’t think anyone will listen to you
* You feel like your voice is wrong somehow or alien
* When you try to talk differently though it feels fake and uncomfortable
* When you do try to record you find yourself procrastinating and putting it off
* Finally when you make the recording you stumble over your words, talk too fast or freeze with nerves
* You spend forever editing your videos and audios  in an attempt to make your voice sound betterYet in your heart of hearts you know you have a message you need to share with people
* Yet in your heart of hearts you know you have a message you need to share with people
