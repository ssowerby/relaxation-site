## Is this you?

* You’ve invested in all the business courses and know what you should be doing but you still feel stuck.
* You’ve been busy all day but at the end of it you’re not sure what you achieved.
* You have lots of ideas but can’t seem to follow through on them.
* You know exactly what you’re supposed to be doing but don’t know where to start.
* You’re finding it difficult to get into your flow. 
* That little voice in your head keeps saying ‘Who am I to be selling my work?’
* The thought of showing people what you do makes you feel sick.
* Sometimes you take steps in your business but not often enough of them or often enough.
* You really want your business to work, your art is your passion but right now it feels more like a hobby.
* You feel guilty taking time to do your art because you know there are so many other parts of your business which aren’t progressing.
