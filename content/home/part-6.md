It’s okay I get it, nobody taught you the mindset skills you were going to need to make your business a success either. But just like your art skills and business know-how, you can master this part too. You can learn to manage your emotions, deal with negative feedback and the anxieties frustrating your progress. You can become aware of the blocks which keep getting in your way so they don’t stop you any more.
