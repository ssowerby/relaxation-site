## How is this different?

What we’re going to do together is different what you’ve done before. We’re not going to try and shoe horn you in to a particular style of speaking because we don’t want you to be a clone of anyone else. We’re going to lean into your natural voice where the magic is so you can get comfortable being you. And it’s you your audience will connect with.
