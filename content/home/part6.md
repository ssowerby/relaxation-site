## Do you really need to speak?

Well if you're making meditations and audios it's a given. For everything else there's so much choice out there now when in comes to communicating what you have to say. You could write a blog, use images and slides on your social media and trainings. Voice over and lip sync on your videos. But you know if you really want your message to hit home it needs to come from you, directly. 

One, because we are all nosey. Who didn't want to to know what the Wizard of Oz was like behind the curtain? And two, and more importantly, it builds trust. If you're offering a 1:1 service like coaching or therapy it takes a lot for someone to reach out and ask to work with you. There's a huge element of trust required when someone shares their issues with you. 

When they get to hear your voice regularly it's a way of potential customers to start to build a relationship with you. Thereâ€™s nothing so engaging as learning something from someone directly who has a passion for that topic. 

At school what was your favourite subject? I bet it was the one with the most engaging teacher wasn't it? Would have you have been so excited by it if you'd only learned from a book?
