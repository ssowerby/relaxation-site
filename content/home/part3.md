## This is the work you were born to do

You know that because you’ve tried the other stuff and you’re an artist down to your bones. This is the one thing that feels true to you. To deny it would be like losing a body part, but you also need it to work. You don’t want a hobby, you want a business you can be proud of.

After my dad died I found out what a talented artist he’d been. He’d given it all up before I was even born because he never believed he could make a career out of his skills. And I remember all the jobs he had  instead. Job he hated and which chipped away at his spark day after day. I don’t want that for you and that’s why I do this.
