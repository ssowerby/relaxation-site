## Voice matters

At school what was your favourite subject? I bet it was the one with the most engaging teacher wasn't it? Would have you have been so excited by it if you'd only learned about it from a book? Voice matters.

When they get to hear your voice regularly it's a way of potential customers to start to build a relationship with you. Thereâ€™s nothing so engaging as learning something from someone directly who has a passion for that topic.
