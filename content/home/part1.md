As a mindset coach for artists and makers I can help you turn your hobby into a business by supporting you to become more confident in your work and taking the actions to grow your business.

I know it’s not enough for you to keep your art to yourself. You don’t want it only to be seen by your family and friends or practically give it away for a lot less than it’s worth. You want to share your passion for your art much wider than that. It’s how you want to spend your days. It’s part of your identity.

When someone asks you ‘what do you do’ you want to confidently tell them you’re an artist and show them. Because you want to have a business that expresses who you are and gives you the freedom to express your creativity and feel free to experiment.

I know right now you’re frustrated with yourself. That you know exactly what you should be doing to make it happen but things just seem to keep getting in the way. One day you’re smashing it and the next you’re distracting yourself with cleaning the house or looking at cat pictures. Your emotions are on a rollercoaster and sometimes you worry you’re not cut out for this.

I also know that despite that frustration you really want this. It’s the work you were born to do and you know that because you’ve tried the other stuff and you’re an artist down to your bones. This is the one thing that feels true to you. To deny it would be like losing a body part, but you also need it to work. You don’t want a hobby, you want a business you can be proud of.

After my dad died I found out what a talented artist he’d been. He’d given it all up before I was even born because he never believed he could make a career out of his skills. And I remember all the jobs he had  instead. Job he hated and which chipped away at his spark day after day. I don’t want that for you and that’s why I do this..
