As a mindset coach for artists and makers I can help you turn your hobby into a business by supporting you to become more confident in your work and taking the actions to grow your business.

I know it’s not enough for you to keep your art to yourself. You don’t want it only to be seen by your family and friends or practically give it away for a lot less than it’s worth. You want to share your passion for your art much wider than that. It’s how you want to spend your days. It’s part of your identity.

I know right now you’re frustrated with yourself. That you know exactly what you should be doing to make it happen but things just seem to keep getting in the way. One day you’re smashing it and the next you’re distracting yourself with cleaning the house or looking at cat pictures. Your emotions are on a rollercoaster and sometimes you worry you’re not cut out for this.
