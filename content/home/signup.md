## But nothing has worked for you before, why will this be any different?

I get that it feels impossible when you’ve tried before but you can do this. My clients have tried brute forcing it with will power or doing other courses and none of it worked for them. 

But within a couple of weeks of working with me they're already recording videos and audios with more ease. Imagine in just a coupel of weeks from you could be making that course you’ve been thinking about for so long? You can be heard and feel confident doing it.

What we’re going to do together is different what you’ve done before. We’re not going to try and shoe horn you in to a particular style of speaking because we don’t want you to be a clone of anyone else. We’re going to lean into your natural voice where the magic is so you can get comfortable being you. And it’s you your audience will connect with.
