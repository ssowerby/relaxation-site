## Changing your voice doesn't work

You know changing your voice doesn’t work and you know feeling the fear and doing it anyway isn’t a way you want to live. So instead I can help you learn to love your voice as it is right now so you can 

* Be confident showing up as you
* Ad lib with ease
* Create recordings in a state of flow
* Make your own courses in your natural voice

These are things my clients are doing within a couple of weeks of working with me.
