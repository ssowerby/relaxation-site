      ### Is this you?
      
      * You don’t like your voice
      * You’ve tried to change your voice with courses or by yourself and it doesn’t work
      * It feels so uncomfortable to talk on video or audio that it all comes out wrong
      * You don’t think anyone will listen to you
      * You feel like your voice is wrong somehow or alien
      * When you try to talk differently though it feels fake and uncomfortable
      * When you do try to record you find yourself procrastinating and putting it off
      * Finally when you make the recording you stumble over your words, talk too fast or freeze with nerves
      * You spend forever editing your videos and audios  in an attempt to make your voice sound better
      * Yet in your heart of hearts you know you have a message you need to share with people

      ## **Won’t it be better when** -
  
      * You feel okay with your voice, even like it
      * You’re comfortable sharing as you, just as you are
      * You are confident in how you sound so you don’t need to think about it so much
      * You feel at ease recording your voice
      * The words flow from you more naturally
      * Editing is much quicker because you’re now you’re okay with your sound
      * You know there are people who will listen and benefit from what you have to say
      * You’re in your flow, doing your thing, spreading your message

      ## How awesome will that be?

      It might sound like a dream right now but my clients have been where you are and within a couple of weeks of starting to work with me  they’re already recording their voice with more confidence and ease.

      You’ve done your  training and gained experience. You have something which is important for you to share with others. And you know it’s important for you to speak directly to those people you want to help. That’s why you’re here. This, is the final piece of the puzzle and just like the other pieces this one can fall into place too.

      ## But could it really work for you?  
      
      You weren’t born having a problem with the way you sound. It’s something you’ve acquired along the way. And you can learn to get past this too. Because on the other side is your future, sharing and connecting, spreading your message.
      
      My clients have usually wrestled with their feelings about their voice for a long time before they come to see me. Some have tried themselves to speak differently and change their voice but it felt fake, unnatural and a huge effort to keep up. Others have been on courses to change their voice but it hasn’t worked for them.
      
      
      
      What’s different about my programme is we’re not going to change your voice, we’re going to change how you feel about it and that’s the key. You will flow more naturally, the words will come with ease and you’ll sound more relaxed because you’re confident with how you sound. And it won’t be an effort to keep up because you’re just being you.

      ## How are we going to do it?

      We’re going to do this through a combination of mindset coaching and practical exercises. In our sessions together we’ll remove any blocks which have been holding you back and boost your confidence in your voice. And between sessions there will be practical exercises to get you into taking regular action towards your goals. You will also get extra support via Messenger 5 days a week. 

      And it will only take you up to 20 minutes a day between sessions to get you into momentum. Less time than you’ve been wasting feeling anxious and procrastinating.

      ## The Cringe to Confidence Voice Programme in a nutshell:

      * 4 x 1:1 coaching calls on Zoom, bespoke to you and your voice goals.
      * Mini exercises of less than 20 minutes a day to get you moving forward.
      * Extra support via Messenger 5 days a week 10-6pm.

      Interested? I only work with people after speaking with them first, to make sure we're a good fit.
