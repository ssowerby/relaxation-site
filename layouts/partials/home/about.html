   <p>Remember the childlike joy you had doing your thing? How you were always jotting down ideas on the nearest scrap of paper or piece of loo roll? Not listening to the guy behind the counter at the coffee shop because you were lost in thought about your latest project? Getting into your flow and not realising how much time has passed until you sip on your coffee and realise it’s stone cold. Lightbulb moments in the shower, walking around the park, on the train?

   <p>Just not feeling it any more?

   <p>Dreading Monday morning to the point you wake up in the night with that sinking feeling? Rearranging your wardrobe or calling a relative you don’t even like just to put off that moment when you sit down in front of the blank paper/screen? Questioning if you even want to do this any more?

   <p>This was supposed to be your dream. This is what you wanted to do with you life but now it’s sucking the joy out of it.

   <p>When did it all become so hard?

   <p>It’s hard to keep that childlike joy of creating with all the pressures of grown up life.

   <p>Now you’re a professional maybe creating to order isn’t as much fun as doing it when you feel like.

   <p>It could be you have clients or a boss who are always pitching in with unworkable ideas.

   <p>The pressures of running a business and a home overwhelming your brain.

   <p>Deadlines playing on your mind.

   <p>Worrying about the finances.

   <p>Heck where is your next idea even coming from?

   <p>There are a lot of variables involved which you can’t control. The one variable you can is you. You can learn to make space for your creativity in your hectic mind and life. To let the rest go and find your flow again, to get back to enjoying your passion. You know the reason you wanted to do this in the first place.

   <p>I can help you sort out the muddle going on between your ears. To find your calm centre even in the storm. To feel that childlike joy again so you can spend more time in flow, doing what you do best.
